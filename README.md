# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project
This project is developed using a  predictive model based to forecast customer churn for an electricity power company, focusing on the SME customer segment.
The project is to predict customers that are likely to churn and devise strategies to reduce the rate.
Random Forest Algorithm is used in this project for the predictive model after the exploratory data analyis has been carried out.
Lots of data cleaning was done to improve the data accuracy, handle redundancy for a good model evaluation and result.
